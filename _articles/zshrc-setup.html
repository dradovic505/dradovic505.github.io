<p>
Here's the contents of my <code>~/.zshrc</code> file. Sometimes I add more depending on my use case but these are the basics!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The first two are for easier access to <code>.zshrc</code> and sourcing it. It can get a bit annoying to type out each time.</li>
    <li>Then there's basic commands to navigate the folder structure and git commands.</li>
    <li><code>jlaunch</code> is for launching <a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/">Jekyll</a>, which is a template framework which I use for this website. The command wipes the existing "build" from the directory and starts up a local server on <code>http://127.0.0.1:4000</code>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/">venv</a> is a very useful program that allows a directory to have its own Python setup. You can set the version and which packages to install. No other folder will be affected!</li>
    <li>I also customized my terminal prompt to be an emote since it's shorter :)</li>
    <li>Finally, I append Ruby paths to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.</li>
</ul>
